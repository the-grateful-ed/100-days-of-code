# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 8th, 2022 


**Today's Progress**: Worked on my Gatsby blog edndacomputer.site. Setting the collections up to be their own routed paths. Added content in markdown using Netlify CMS. Install YouTube embed.

**Thoughts:** Had some trouble with GraohQl but Im starting to get real comfortable with it after this blog.
